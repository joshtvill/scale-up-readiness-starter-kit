# Scale-Up Readiness Starter Kit

Modular planning tools to support process scale-up, tech transfer readiness, and cross-functional enablement in production manufacturing environments.

---

## Use Case

This starter kit helps engineering and MSAT teams coordinate upstream-to-production process transfers. It focuses on systems-level planning, documentation maturity, and cross-functional alignment to reduce delays, clarify ownership, and build transfer readiness across technical, QA, and supply chain interfaces.

Common challenges this kit supports include:
- Vague or shifting definitions of “ready for scale-up”
- Misalignment between development and manufacturing expectations
- Missing process documentation or tool readiness status
- Cross-site transfer confusion and ownership ambiguity
- Fragmented system readiness across facilities, QA, and ops teams

## Folder Structure & Components

Each subfolder contains implementation-ready scaffolds or templates to support specific initiatives:

### `/templates/`
- SOP-style forms
- Process transfer checklists
- Change management whitepapers
- FMEA + CI ownership trackers

### `/trackers/`
- Gantt timelines
- Task ownership matrices
- BOM readiness logs
- Process readiness and cross-site change trackers

### `/calculators/`
- Material usage-per-unit cost models
- Tool availability (PM-based) calculators

### `/reference/`
- Glossary of readiness terms
- Transfer-readiness logic maps
- Tool install and IQ/OQ/PQ workflow guides

### `/diagrams/` *(optional)*
- Visual stage-gate maps
- Transfer dependency flowcharts

Each folder includes a `README.md` explaining usage and intent of the tools provided.

## How to Use

This kit is designed to be modular — teams can adapt individual components or use them as a complete pre-transfer coordination package. Recommended starting points:

- For new process rollouts → Start with `/trackers/Process Readiness Tracker`
- For cross-site transfer efforts → Use `/templates/Cross-Site Process Transfer Checklist`
- For tool install coordination → Refer to `/reference/Tool Install Workflow Guide`
- For risk reduction and CI → Begin with `/templates/FMEA + CI Tracker`

All Excel-based tools follow a uniform style with:
- Pre-populated example rows
- Conditional formatting where applicable
- Standardized change log tabs

## Disclaimers

This toolkit is not a regulatory guidance document, protocol library, or MES substitute. It does not replace internal SOPs, but is intended to support operational clarity and systems coordination around scale-up and transfer efforts.

---

## Who This Is / Isn’t For

**This kit is designed for:**
- MSAT engineers supporting pilot-to-GMP process transitions
- Staff-level process or systems engineers managing tech transfer readiness
- Systems integration leads coordinating across QA, facilities, and operations

**This kit is not intended for:**
- Auditors or certifying bodies (without customization)
- Scientific teams developing product-specific protocols
- Automation teams building full MES or LIMS integrations
