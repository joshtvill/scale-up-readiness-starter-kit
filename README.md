# Scale-Up Readiness Starter Kit

Modular planning tools to support process scale-up, tech transfer readiness, and cross-functional enablement in production manufacturing environments.

---

## Use Case

This starter kit supports engineering, MSAT, and systems integration teams in managing upstream-to-production readiness. It focuses on documentation maturity, handoff alignment, and cross-functional coordination during process transfers, new tool installs, or scale-up initiatives.

It is designed for environments where quality, speed, and team interoperability must be balanced — including GMP, ISO 9001, or multi-site operations.

Common challenges this kit addresses:
- Vague or shifting definitions of “ready for scale-up”
- Misalignment between development and manufacturing expectations
- Cross-site transfer ambiguity and tool mismatches
- Fragmented system readiness across QA, automation, and production
- Risk of overloading teams with non-adoptable documentation or disconnected assets

## Folder Structure & Components

Each folder contains implementation-ready tools, templates, or trackers mapped to a specific initiative:

### `/templates/`
- `cross_site_transfer_checklist.xlsx` — verifies cross-site process alignment
- `handoff_criteria_template.docx` — defines gate conditions for engineering-to-ops transfer
- `process_change_checklist.xlsx` — logs and stages change requests
- `process_change_whitepaper_template.docx` — documents rationale and outcomes of major changes
- `training_material_repository_template.xlsx` — organizes SOP and training asset readiness
- `pareto_tracker_template.xlsx` — categorizes and visualizes problem contributors
- `seq_validation_template.xlsx` — validates tool variability over time using SEQ methodology

### `/trackers/`
- `process_readiness_tracker.xlsx` — tracks transfer readiness across ownership lanes
- `process_maturity_scorecard.xlsx` — evaluates documentation and process maturity against predefined criteria  
- `engineering_ownership_matrix.xlsx` — clarifies responsibilities across functions
- `training_completion_matrix.xlsx` — logs and verifies staff training status
- `cross_site_change_tracker.xlsx` — synchronizes ongoing change propagation
- `basic_bom_tracker_template.xlsx` — ensures BOM component traceability
- `gantt_timeline_tracker.xlsx` — visualizes handoff and validation timelines
- `tool_readiness_tracker.xlsx` — flags install and calibration completion state
- `fmea_ci_tracker.xlsx` — captures known risks and ongoing mitigations
- `ownership_vs_risk_matrix.xlsx` — aligns owners to high-risk failure modes
- `scale_up_risk_score_tracker.xlsx` — quantifies readiness and risk by category

### `/calculators/`
- `material_cost_calculator.xlsx` — maps material usage to cost per unit
- `availability_calculator.xlsx` — estimates tool availability based on PM schedule

### `/reference/`
- `tool_install_workflow_guide.docx` — walkthrough of IQ/OQ/PQ stages and owner logic
- `transfer_readiness_mapping.md` — maps all assets to their usecase and readiness initiative

## How to Use

This kit is designed to be modular and adaptive — teams can adopt tools individually or deploy them as a full coordination system. All files are editable and built for practical use in production or regulated environments.

Recommended entry points:
- **New process introduction** → start with `process_readiness_tracker.xlsx`
- **Cross-site transfer** → begin with `cross_site_transfer_checklist.xlsx`
- **Tool installation** → follow `tool_install_workflow_guide.docx`
- **Validation consistency** → use `seq_validation_template.xlsx`
- **Engineering-to-ops handoff** → apply `handoff_criteria_template.docx`
- **Risk-driven CI** → implement `fmea_ci_tracker.xlsx` and `pareto_tracker_template.xlsx`

All Excel-based tools include:
- Pre-filled examples
- Change logs
- Conditional formatting (where applicable)

Where initiatives span multiple functions, refer to `transfer_readiness_mapping.md` for coordinated adoption pathways.

This kit intentionally balances thoroughness with usability. Assets are designed to reduce ambiguity, not increase documentation overhead. Teams may selectively adopt trackers that streamline execution. For broader rollout, assets can be aligned to existing review structures, or used as scaffolds for iterative feedback.

## Disclaimers

This kit is not a regulatory protocol library, execution system, or formal audit substitute. It complements — but does not replace — internal SOPs, MES, LIMS, or QMS tools. It is designed to support clarity, traceability, and systems coordination across readiness-driven initiatives.

## Who This Is / Isn’t For

**This kit is designed for:**
- MSAT and process engineers preparing upstream process transfers
- Staff-level engineers managing readiness across tools, automation, QA
- Cross-functional leads coordinating change, install, and production prep

**This kit is not intended for:**
- Certifying bodies or auditors (without customization)
- Scientists creating product-specific protocols
- Automation-only teams building end-to-end system logic
